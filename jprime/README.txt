=========== ABOUT JPRIME ===========

Thank you for using JPrIME!

JPrIME is a Java library primarily aimed at phylogenetics,
although other functionality may be added over time as well.

The package is developed and maintained by the computational biology
groups at Science for Life Laboratory Stockholm (http://www.scilifelab.se/).
It has its roots in a C++ library named PrIME, primarily developed by PIs
Jens Lagergren, Lars Arvestadx	 and Bengt Sennblad. Frequent contributors to
JPrIME includes Joel Sjöstrand, Raja Hashim Ali, Ikram Ullah, Owais Mahmudhi,
and Auwn Muhammed.



=========== INSTALLATION ===========

JPrIME should come as a single JAR file bundled with all external
dependencies. It will most likely be named 'jprime-X.Y.Z.jar', with
X.Y.Z referring to its current incarnation.

You may place the JAR file anywhere on your computer. However, for frequent use,
you may want to add its location to your CLASSPATH or similarly, as outlined
here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_(Java).

Alternatively, the location of the JAR file can be specified explicitly when you
start an application such as in this fictitious example:

java -cp ~/mypath/jprime-X.Y.Z.jar se/cbb/jprime/apps/MyApp
