/**
 * Abstract class for trees and data structures pertaining to William H. E. Day's
 * article "Optimal Algorithms for Comparing Trees with Labeled Leaves",
 * Journal of Classification, 1985.
 * <p/>
 * More specifically, instances provide access to the "post-order sequences with weights", PSW:
 * <li>Leaves of the tree are labelled with integers from 0 to |L(T)|-1.</li>
 * <li>For each interior vertex, the leaf label span of its descendant subtree is stored as a
 * (min,max) pair. The weight (number of proper descendants), and number of leaves are also stored.</li>
 * </ul>
 * These properties may be used to create a "cluster table"; a data structure used
 * for efficient computation of strict consensus trees, the Robinson-Foulds distance metric, etc.
 * <p/>
 * Input trees may be treated as rooted or unrooted.
 * On a side note, in the latter case, since the internal topology is in fact rooted, the
 * input tree is rerooted at a leaf. This implies that the topology is reduced by one or
 * two vertices (the leaf and possibly the original root).
 * <p/>
 * Two implementations are provided:
 * <ol>
 * <li><code>ClusterTablePSWTree</code>: Labels the leaves as traversed in a DFS, then computes the PSW and
 * creates a cluster table.</li>
 * <li><code>TemplatedPSWTree</code>: Labels the leaves based on a ClusterTableTree template, then computes
 * the PSW. Used for comparisons with the template.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Behaviour for a trees with a single leaf or single interior vertex is undefined.
