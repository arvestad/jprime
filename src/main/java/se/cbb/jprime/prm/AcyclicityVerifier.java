/**
 * Interface for verifiers of acyclicity on a PRM dependency structure or
 * induced Bayesian network.
 * <p/>
 * There are two acyclicity conditions of different strengths:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The structure itself is acyclic, i.e. the "template graph" is acyclic.
 *     This is the stricter of the two.</li>
 * <li>The structure itself is not acyclic, but the complete Bayesian network induced
 *     by the PRM entities are acyclic. This is weaker (and significantly tougher to verify),
 *     but may be desirable when modelling more complex PRMs.</li>
 * </ol>
 * An aspect to note similar to acyclicity is the existence of "parallel arcs",
 * that is, dependencies with the same parent and child but with different slot chains.
 * Such are perfectly allowed, unless otherwise stated.
 * <p/>
 * For more details, see section 4.1, <i>Learning Probabilistic Relational
 * Models, Friedman et al., 1999</i>.
