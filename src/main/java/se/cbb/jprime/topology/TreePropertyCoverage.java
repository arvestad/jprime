 * Simple enumeration which can be used for specifying how much of a

 * names) applies to.
 * <p/>
 * For convenience, one may choose to verify if a coverage is in fact a superset
 * or (more rarely) a subset of another coverage. E.g. if one has retrieved the coverage
 * of vertices with names, one may wish to proceed as long as that is a superset of the leaves.
 * <p/>
 * In case of small trees where several enumeration alternatives are in fact equal,
 * it is up to implementing functions to produce consistent results (e.g. for a one-vertex
 * tree don't mix 'ALL', 'ONLY_ROOT' and 'ONLY_LEAVES').
