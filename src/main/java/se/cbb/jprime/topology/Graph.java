/**
 * Base interface for implementations of graphs, whether directed, partially directed
 * or undirected. The interface allows multiple disjoint components, although
 * implementations/sub-interfaces may of course specialise to contain only one.
 * <p/>
 * All vertices are referenced by unique integer IDs which must range from
 * 0 to |V(G)|-1. The behaviour when providing
 * a method an out-of-bounds ID is undefined, and may very well result in an error.
 * Implementations are encouraged to indicate null references by -1, for
 * which there is a shorthand named 'NULL' in this interface.
 * <p/>
 * Important note: Methods returning or setting reference data types may refer to
 * the direct underlying data structures of the instance. Therefore, it may not be
 * safe to e.g. alter returned values unless explicitly intended in some cases.
