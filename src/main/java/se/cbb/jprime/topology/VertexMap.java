/**
 * Interface for holders of per-vertex values for a graph G, e.g. vertex names.
 * A value is accessed using the integer ID of the vertex.
 * <p/>
 * Owing to the often complex relationship between a map M and its graph G, M is not
 * automatically made a dependent of G. However, the user may of course explicitly
 * specify this.
 * <p/>
 * Naturally, for trees, one may use a map for arc values too. In particular,
 * using the head y for access of
 * an arc (x,y) is useful when one is dealing with trees where there is a requirement
 * of a "pseudo-arc" predating the root (for which one may thus store a value using
 * the root without having to introduce an extra vertex in the tree).
