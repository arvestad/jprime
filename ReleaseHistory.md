# 0.3.6

- Branchlengths in DLRS and DLTRS are now limited to 10. Sometimes, the MCMC strayed way passed that and later died because the appropriate substitution matrix could not be computed.
- Fixed an unnoticed long-lasting bug: appending `fixed` to a rate parameter did not, in fact, fix that parameter, contrary to what the documentation said.

# 0.3.5a to 0.3.5f

Bug fixes.

# Prior to 0.3.5

There are rumours that there were version released here, but this is all unconfirmed. ;-)
